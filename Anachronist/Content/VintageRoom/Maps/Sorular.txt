Q1 :For 50 bucks I would consider this asset as bought but 130 euros are way too much for something this small...

Q2:I have some of your futuristic assets, and I love them. You guys put out some wonderful stuff! However, my jaw almost dropped when I saw the price for this one. It seems a tad extreme for not very much.. Also to liven up the screenshots a bit I would add some grass. Looks weird with just the bare landscape. Still looks like a nice pack though! But I would definitely reconsider that price point, just saying!
